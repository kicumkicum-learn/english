The history of video games goes [as far back](eche "еще") as the early **1950s**,
when academic computer scientists began designing simple games
and simulations as part of their research.

Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the **1970s** and **1980s**,
when video arcade games and gaming consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers,
[along](vmeste "вместе") with graphics on computer screens and home
computer games were introduced to the general public.

Since the 1980s, video gaming [has become](staly "стали") a popular form of entertainment
and a part of modern popular culture in most parts of the world.

One of the [early](rannih "рано, ранних") games was **Spacewar!**,
which was developed by computer scientists.

Early arcade video games developed from 1972 to 1978. [During](v_techenie "В течение") the 1970s,
the first generation of home consoles [emerged](voznikli 'возникли'),
including the popular game Pong and [various](razlichnyh 'различных') "clones".

The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games.
The golden age of arcade video games was from 1978 to 1982.

Video arcades with large, graphics-decorated coin-operated machines
were common at malls and popular, affordable home consoles such as
the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people to play games on their home TVs.

[During](v_techenie "В течение") the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming
and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was affected by the video game crash of 1983.

From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged.

The third generation of consoles, which were 8-bit units, emerged from 1983 to 1995.

The fourth generation of consoles, which were 16-bit models, emerged from 1987 to 1999.

The 1990s saw the [resurgence](vozrozhdenie "возрождение") and [decline](upadok "упадок") of arcades,
the [transition](perehod 'переход') to 3D video games, [improved](uluchenie 'улучшение') handheld games,
and PC gaming.

The fifth generation of consoles, which were 32 and 64-bit units, was from 1993 to 2006.

[During](v_techenie 'в течение') this era, mobile phone gaming [emerged](voznikli 'возникли').

During the 2000s, the sixth generation of consoles emerged (1998–2013).

During this period, online gaming and mobile games became important.

The seventh generation of consoles was from 2005 to 2012.

This era was marked by huge development budgets for some games,
with some having cinematic graphics; the launch of the top-selling Wii console,
in which the user could control the game actions with real-life
[movement](dvizenie 'движения') of the controller;
the [rise](pod'em 'подъем') of casual PC games marketed to non-gamers;
and the [emergence](poyavlenie 'появление') of cloud computing in video games.
